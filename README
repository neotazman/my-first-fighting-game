My First Fighting Game

# Notes

this is based from a youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&t=99s

Sprite images come from: https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-plataformer-painted-style?download

# Things I Changed

# html (HTML5)

# css 
    a) style.css as opposed to inline

    b) % as opposed to pixels

    c) it would be much harder for me to figure out how to do reverseHealthBar on my own, so i'm ignoring it for right now

# javascript

    a) did the timer on my own without watching the video

    b) added gameOver

    c) made a background class extending sprite with fewer arguments
variable names (to something i understand)

    d) the background sprites I used were animated, so I added in functions to animate them

    e) didn't do the shop animation -- doing a bomb animation with a two dimensional sprite

    f)
