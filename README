My First Fighting Game

# Notes

this is based from a youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&t=99s

# Things I Changed

html (HTML5)
css 
    a) style.css as opposed to inline

    b) % as opposed to pixels

    c) gameInfo is set to flex (he changed to that anyway)

    d) did the timer on my own without watching the video

    e) it would be much harder for me to figure out how to do reverseHealthBar on my own, so i'm ignoring it for right now

    f) gamestate
variable names (to something i understand)
